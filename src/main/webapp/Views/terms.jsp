                terms and conditions which relate to your agreement and also agreeing to abide
                by them. In turn we also acknowledge our own obligations to this agreement, by
                means of providing the service you require, this means we will provide the
                service to you the customer. As we will be providing a service to our customer
                we therefore have no obligation to another party, only our customer. Please also
                be aware that if a client uses our services on behalf of a third party our
                obligation will still be with you being our customer furthermore the terms and
                conditions will also relate to you our customer and not with any other third
                parties.

        <div class="terms-pg">
            <h5 class="wow fadeInUp">Our Service Limitations</h5>
            <p>UsaSpeedyLoan is an finance broker, although unlike many finance brokers, we will
                not charge you a fee for the broker services, we will find lenders and providers
                of financial services for you. We do usually receive a commission for matching
                you with a lender or provider of a financial service. Any examples of amounts
                available to borrow, terms (repayment periods) or rates stated on our website
                are purely given as a representative example relating to the product. These
                representative examples are stated to give our customers an understanding of the
                products available. Representative examples are not given as a figure of what
                our customers will actually be offered by the lender/finance provider, therefore
                cannot be given as a guarantee nor can they be used as any kind of warranty. If
                we do not provide the loan or financial service directly, we are unable to
                control the representative rate examples contained on our website. Please also
                be aware that the decision to offer any short term loan or financial service is
                made by the lender or finance provider and UsaSpeedyLoan has no control over other
                financial providers decision making. The lender/finance provider will conduct an
                assessment on each customer before any decision or offer is made; this will
                include a full assessment of a customer credit history past and present.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="terms-pg">
            <h5 class="wow fadeInUp">Customer Checks & Referencing</h5>
            <p>UsaSpeedyLoan may carry out any credit checks or referencing on any customer upon
                registering to our services, also, the finance providers/lenders may use credit
                scoring facilities and credit referencing agencies to determine how eligible the
                customer is when making an assessment on the customer. Credit checks and credit
                reference agencies can also help prevent fraudulent applications so we ask
                clients to agree to using data provided for the purpose of preventing fraud and
                ensuring the client's identity is as claimed. Information provided by the client
                must always be true and accurate, as misleading information will be regarded as
                a breach of our terms and is likely to breach any agreement the client has
                entered into with the lenders and financiers we work alongside. Furthermore,
                misleading information may also result in the instigation of criminal procedures
                against the client. If the client has authorised any third parties to access the
                service on behalf of the client's instructions issued by authorised third
                parties will be contractually binding on the client on whose behalf the third
                party is acting.</p>
